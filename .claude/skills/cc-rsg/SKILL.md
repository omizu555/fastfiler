# cc-rsg (Claude Code Reverse Spec Generator)

A general-purpose framework that reverse-engineers maintenance- or delivery-targeted specification documents from existing codebases (legacy or current).

This skill operates in the "code → spec" direction; it is the symmetric counterpart of `cc-sdd` (Spec Driven Development). Both belong to the same family of tools.

> **🌐 Language policy: English is the base language; Japanese is opt-in.**

> The default for `goal.json.output_language` is `"en"` (or the user's
> UI-language hint passed from the parent harness). Phase 0 MUST ask
> the user to confirm. After Phase 0, **all deliverables follow

## Design principles

This skill operates under the following 11 principles. They are mutually reinforcing; if any one breaks, the reliability of the whole skill collapses.

1. **Goal-driven**: Phase 0 fixes the goal through a 5-question choice-based dialogue and persists it to `.cc-rsg/goal.json`. All subsequent phases reference this goal.
2. **Hybrid template decision**: Supports three template sources — the user's own template, a Claude-recommended template (derived from reconnaissance), or a user-adjusted version of the recommendation.
3. **Reference-based inventory unit selection**: `references/inventory-units.md` lists typical units per language/framework; the relevant patterns for the target codebase are chosen from there.
4. **Gap-prevention is anchored on inventory-based verification**: Enumerate every extractable unit from the code and mechanically check whether the spec covers each one.
5. **Question Bank is populated at 3 moments**: end of reconnaissance (high-level questions), during sub-agent investigation (detail questions), and at verification (consistency questions). Classified into 7 standard categories.
6. **Sub-agents decide dynamically based on question severity**: Critical → leave the section blocked. Important / nice-to-have → proceed with an inference, leaving a marker.
7. **Question merge is automatic only for "obviously identical"**: "Similar but subtly different" questions are grouped and surfaced to the user for judgement.
8. **The dialogue protocol is Claude-driven**: Choice-based questions are the default; free-form input is a fallback. AskUserQuestion-style choice UIs are exploited to the maximum.
9. **Unanswerable questions are marked `abandoned`**: They are explicitly recorded in the final spec under "unresolved items", never hidden.
10. **Dual-consumer handling is reduced to one in goal definition**: If multiple views are needed, restart instead of overloading a single spec.
11. **Output language is chosen in Phase 0 (English / 日本語) — English is the BASE language**: The very first dialogue is bilingual (English first, then Japanese). The default selection is provided by the parent harness's initial prompt (the user's UI-language hint; falls back to `"en"`). The answer is persisted to `.cc-rsg/goal.json` as `output_language` (`"en"` or `"ja"`). All subsequent natural-language output — AskUserQuestion bodies and choices, progress messages, confirmation summaries, generated spec body and chapter titles, `questions.json` `body` / `answer`, Phase 4 verification reports, resume messages — uses that language. Internal identifiers and machine-readable elements — state keys (`current_phase` etc.), IDs (`Q-XXX` / `INV-XXX`), file names (ASCII slug), `[REF: file:lines]`, `[CONFIDENCE: HIGH|MED|LOW]`, `[ASK SME]`, `[ASSUMED: ...]`, `[BLOCKED: ...]` marker names, and `goal.json` enum values (`primary_reader: "maintenance_developer"` etc.) — stay English **regardless of `output_language`**. The literal `## Sources Read` heading also stays English (so `coverage-check.py` pattern-matches it). The entire skill bundle (this SKILL.md, `agents/`, `variants/`, `templates/*.md`, `references/*.md`, and `scripts/*.py` docstrings / messages) is English-base. When `output_language == "ja"`, the agent dynamically renders deliverable text (chapter body, AskUserQuestion bodies, progress messages, etc.) in Japanese while preserving every machine-readable element verbatim.

## Mermaid styling contract (mandatory)

Every Mermaid diagram emitted into `drafts/` or `final/` MUST be **structure-only — no color, no node-level fill, no per-node styling**. The rendering host supplies a theme-aware palette via CSS variables (`--mermaid-node-bg`, `--mermaid-line`, etc.) and switches it on light / dark / auto theme changes. Hardcoded colors in the diagram source **override the host palette**, break dark mode, and look "decorated by whim" because the agent has no spec-defined convention to follow.

**Forbidden** in Mermaid source:

- ❌ `style A fill:#e1f5ff` / `style B fill:#fff9c4` / any per-node `style ... fill:`
- ❌ `classDef foo fill:#...` / `class A foo` color-bearing class definitions
- ❌ `stroke:#...` / `color:#...` / any hex / rgb / named-color literal anywhere in the diagram body
- ❌ `linkStyle 0 stroke:#...,stroke-width:3px` (color part forbidden; width-only is fine)

**Allowed** (these convey structure, not decoration):

- ✅ Edge arrow types (`-->`, `-.->`, `==>`, `--x`, `--o`)
- ✅ Edge labels (`A -->|owns| B`)
- ✅ Node shapes (`A[...]`, `A(...)`, `A{...}`, `A>...]`, `A((...))`) — shape carries meaning (rectangle / round / diamond / etc.)
- ✅ Subgraphs (`subgraph Group ... end`) for grouping
- ✅ Diagram types (`graph TB`, `flowchart LR`, `sequenceDiagram`, `erDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `classDiagram`)
- ✅ Direction modifiers (`TB`, `LR`, etc.) on the top line

**Why this contract exists**: in a previous run the agent emitted `style A fill:#e1f5ff` etc. in one chapter (and only one chapter, inconsistently), picking pale Material-Design colors based on its own interpretation of node semantics. There is **no convention recorded in this skill** that maps semantics to colors, so any color the agent picks is fabricated. Removing color from the source lets the host's themed palette do its job consistently across all diagrams.

If a particular node needs visual emphasis, use **shape** (e.g. diamond for decision, double-circle for terminal state) — not color.

## 6-phase state machine overview

The skill is implemented as a 6-phase state machine. Progress is tracked in `.cc-rsg/state.json` and is pause-and-resume safe.

| Phase | Name | Main deliverables |
|-------|------|------------|
| 0 | Setup & Goal | `.cc-rsg/goal.json` |
| 1 | Recon & Template | `recon-report.md`, template selection result |
| 2 | Plan & WBS | `inventory.json`, `wbs.json` |
| 3 | Investigate | `drafts/*.md` (per-chapter drafts) |
| 4 | Verify | coverage report, consistency questions |
| 5 | Refine via Dialogue | resolved `questions.json` |
| 6 | Deliver | final spec under `final/` |

Each phase is defined in detail in the sections below.

---

## Phase 0: Setup & Goal

### Purpose
Right after the skill starts, fix the scope and the goal. Every later decision derives from the goal defined here.

### Procedure

1. **Project confirmation**
   - Start from the current working directory and identify the target project.
   - Ask the user "Is this the right root directory for the target codebase?". If not, obtain the correct path.

2. **Initialize the state directory**
   - Create the `.cc-rsg/` directory.
   - If an existing `.cc-rsg/state.json` is found, branch to resume mode (see "State management and resume" below).

3. **Output language selection**

   - **This step alone is presented bilingually** because the user's preferred language has not yet been confirmed. The question body and choice labels appear in both English and Japanese.
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` with:
     - Question: `Select the output language for the dialogue and the generated specs / 対話と生成ドキュメントの出力言語を選択してください`
     - Choices (**fixed order; English is the default**):
       1. `English`
       2. `日本語 (Japanese)`
     - `allow_multiple = false`, `allow_free_text = false`
   - Map the selected label to `output_language`: `English` → `"en"`, `日本語 (Japanese)` → `"ja"`. Persistence to `goal.json` happens together with the other answers in Step 5.
   - **Default policy (English-base)**: when the user submits without changing the highlighted choice, treat the answer as `"en"`. This matches the cc-rsg upstream policy.
   - **Parent-harness hint precedence**: when the parent harness injects a `userUiLanguage` hint into the initial prompt, use that hint to decide which choice is **pre-highlighted** (`en` highlights `English`; `ja` highlights `日本語 (Japanese)`). The hint never overrides the user's explicit selection. Priority order:
     1. The user's explicit click in this step (highest)
     2. `userUiLanguage` hint passed from the parent harness's initial prompt
     3. Hard default `"en"` (lowest)
   - **All natural-language output from Step 4 onward** — `AskUserQuestion` bodies and choices, confirmation summaries, chapter titles, generated spec body, `questions.json` body text, etc. — is rendered in the language selected here (see Design Principle #11).
   - **Resume mode**: when `.cc-rsg/goal.json` already exists, read the persisted `output_language` and skip this step entirely.

4. **Run the 5 goal-definition questions**
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the following 5 questions in sequence. **Question bodies, choice labels, and free-form-input placeholders are all rendered in the `output_language` selected in Step 3.** The choice labels below are shown when `output_language == "en"`; the agent dynamically translates them when `output_language == "ja"` (enum values such as `primary_reader: "maintenance_developer"` stay as language-independent English enums in `goal.json`). Each question is choice-based first with a free-form field as a fallback.
   - **Question-text quality contract (applies to every `AskUserQuestion` call in every phase, especially when translating into `output_language == "ja"`)**:
     1. **NEVER JSON-escape characters.** Emit raw UTF-8 only. If you find yourself writing `あ` or any other `\uXXXX` form inside the `question` or `choices` strings, that is a defect — decode it before emitting. A user who sees `次の中` on screen will reject the run.
     2. **Use only standard Japanese kanji.** Stay within JIS Level 1 / 常用漢字 / 人名用漢字. Do NOT mix in Chinese-simplified variants (e.g. `优 (Chinese)` ← write `優 (Japanese)`; `寸叧` is not a valid word — `対応` is). The runtime has no automatic fix for these; they reach the user verbatim.
     3. **Self-check before emit.** After translating a label to Japanese, mentally re-read it. If any kanji feels unusual for the surrounding context — e.g. `妊` (pregnancy) appearing in `業務妊当性` instead of `妥` (`妥当性` = validity) — regenerate the entire label. Common confusion pairs to double-check: 妥/妊, 暑/署, 復/複, 製/制, 即/則.
     4. **No invented characters / kanji.** If you are unsure of a kanji, use kana (e.g. write `たいおう` instead of `寸叧`). Hiragana is always safer than a wrong kanji.
     5. These rules apply to **`AskUserQuestion` bodies and choices**, but they do NOT relax the rule that JSON keys, enum values, file names, and machine-readable markers stay English (see Principle #11).

   **Q1. Who is the primary reader of the spec?**
   - Maintenance developer
   - Delivery customer
   - SME (subject-matter expert)
   - Regulator
   - Other (free-form)

   **Q2. What will the reader do after reading the spec?**
   - Code change
   - Approval decision
   - Audit
   - Learning
   - Other (free-form)

   **Q3. What level of granularity is preferred?**
   - High-level overview
   - Medium
   - Detailed
   - Other (free-form)

   **Q4. Which perspectives should be emphasised? (multi-select)**
   - Functional correctness
   - Business validity
   - Security
   - Operability
   - Performance
   - Other (free-form)

   **Q5. What about existing documentation?**
   - No existing docs
   - Existing docs / want to update
   - Existing docs / want to coexist
   - Existing docs / want to retire
   - Other (free-form)

5. **Extract `user_custom_deliverables` from `free_text_notes`**
   - **Mandatory.** Before persisting `goal.json`, scan `free_text_notes` for explicit deliverable filenames using the regex `\b[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*\.md\b` (case-insensitive). De-duplicate and exclude any name matching the chapter-naming regex `^(0\d|[1-9]\d)-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$` or the reserved names `00-metadata.md` / `99-unresolved.md` / `traceability.md` (those are handled by the standard chapter pipeline).
   - The remaining names are **user-promised custom deliverables**. They MUST appear in `final/` at Phase 6 completion; missing any of them is a hard failure (check 12 in `coverage-check.py`).
   - Example: `free_text_notes = "顧客向けドキュメント。Mermaid図による視覚的説明と、紙芝居的な manual.md を含める。"` → `user_custom_deliverables = ["manual.md"]`.
   - If the free-form text is empty or contains no `*.md` references, the list is `[]`.
   - User-custom files are **exempt from comprehensive per-chapter quality gates** (the 200-lines / 10-REFs / Mermaid / Sources Read minimums) because their quality bar is the user's intent recorded in `free_text_notes`, not the source-derived spec-chapter bar. Only existence + non-empty body is enforced.

6. **Persist to `goal.json`**
   - Save the language choice from Step 3, the 5 answers from Step 4, and the `user_custom_deliverables` array from Step 5 as a structured `goal.json` under `.cc-rsg/`. Schema:

   ```json
   {
     "output_language": "en",
     "primary_reader": "maintenance_developer",
     "reader_action": "code_change",
     "granularity": "medium",
     "perspectives": ["functional_correctness", "operational"],
     "existing_docs": "none",
     "free_text_notes": "...",
     "user_custom_deliverables": ["manual.md"]
   }
   ```
   - `output_language` is required and must be `"en"` or `"ja"`. Other enum fields (`primary_reader`, `reader_action`, `granularity`, `perspectives`, `existing_docs`) are language-independent English enums (localized only at display time using `output_language`).
   - `user_custom_deliverables` is a (possibly empty) array of file names that the user explicitly requested in `free_text_notes`. These bypass the chapter-naming regex; their filenames are preserved verbatim. Phase 2 adds them to `wbs.json` as `kind: "user_custom"` chapters; Phase 6 verifies every one of them exists in `final/`.

7. **Phase 0 complete**
   - Update `state.json` and proceed to Phase 1.

### Phase-specific cautions
- Minimise the user's burden by leading with choice-based UI; never force the user to type the same thing twice.
- Treat the free-form field as a "none of the above" safety net; it is unnecessary when the user picked one of the choices.
- The goal influences every later phase, so do not skip summarising the answers and asking the user to confirm. **The confirmation summary is also rendered in `output_language`.**
- The output-language selection (Step 3) is **bilingual only for that first dialogue**. From Step 4 on, use the confirmed language exclusively. If the user requests a language switch mid-flight, update `goal.json.output_language` and individually check whether existing `drafts/` and `questions.json` bodies need to be re-rendered.

## Phase 1: Recon & Template

### Purpose
Get a rough mental model of the codebase via a shallow reconnaissance, then pick an appropriate spec template. At the end of Phase 1, register the high-level questions into the Question Bank.

### Procedure

1. **Run the shallow reconnaissance**
   Read the following and summarise them in `recon-report.md`:
   - File tree structure (limited to depth 3-4, noise excluded)
   - Package-manager files (`package.json`, `composer.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc.)
   - Entry-point candidates (`main` functions, `index` files, routing definitions, etc.)
   - Existing documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`, `wiki`, etc.)
   - Build/deploy configuration (`Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, CI configs, etc.)
   - Language mix and estimated line counts

2. **Present template candidates**
   - Consult `references/template-catalog.md` and propose candidates suitable for the target codebase.
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to present the candidates to the user.

   **Example template choices**:
   - I have my own template (specify path)
   - Web application spec (`templates/web-app.md`)
   - Batch processing system spec (`templates/batch-system.md`)
   - API service spec (`templates/api-service.md`)
   - Library/SDK spec (`templates/library-sdk.md`)
   - Use whichever Claude recommends from reconnaissance

3. **Adjust the chosen template**
   - If the user accepts Claude's recommendation, display the chapter outline and ask "Are there chapters to add, remove, or rename?".
   - Reflect any additions/removals.

4. **Register high-level questions**
   - Add the fundamental questions surfaced during reconnaissance (questions that block big-picture understanding) into `questions.json`.
   - Examples:
     - What business problem is this system trying to solve?
     - How wide is the scope (which module inside the monorepo)?
     - When existing docs disagree with the code, which is authoritative?
   - See "Question Bank operation" below for the structure used at registration.

5. **🆕 depth-mode decision (scale-based)**
   - Record the **total file count** observed during reconnaissance at the top of `recon-report.md`. Persist as `total_files` in `.cc-rsg/state.json`.
   - **If file count > 200**, ask the user with `AskUserQuestion` to choose a **depth mode**:
     - `comprehensive`: classic behaviour. All chapters detailed, full MECE, full REFs. **Recommended only when exhaustive coverage is required (audit, regulatory).** Takes hours to days.
     - `outline` (**recommended default**): each level's entities are **listed exhaustively in tables** + Mermaid diagrams + a "deep-dive candidates" list at the end of each table. Details are produced on-demand in dialogue after Phase 6. **Best for typical use.**
     - `interactive`: same flow as outline, plus continued deep-dive acceptance after Phase 6 completes. **Use when a team will continue referencing the spec.**
   - **If file count ≤ 200**, default to `comprehensive` automatically (no question). The user may still override.
   - Persist the result to `.cc-rsg/goal.json` as `depth_mode: "comprehensive" | "outline" | "interactive"`. Phases 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 branch on this value.
   - Question wording example:
     > The target codebase is large (N files / X lines). Choose a depth mode for the spec.
     > (Overview-only → deep-dive items of interest later, in practice, is recommended.)

6. **Phase 1 complete**
   - Update `state.json` and proceed to Phase 2.

### Phase-specific cautions
- Reconnaissance follows the principle "shallow but wide". Detailed logic understanding is deferred to Phase 3.
- Without noise exclusion (`node_modules`, `vendor`, `.git`, etc.) the output explodes.
- If the user brings their own template, you may point out "Claude's recommendation differs", but the decision is the user's.

---

## Phase 2: Plan & WBS

### Purpose
Finalise the skeleton of the spec, decompose the work to fill each chapter into a WBS of sub-tasks, and extract the inventory into `inventory.json`.

### Procedure

1. **Apply the chapter file naming convention and generate the skeleton**
   - Every chapter file falls into one of three kinds; free naming by Claude is forbidden.
     - **Standard chapter** (`kind: "standard"`): `{NN}-{slug}.md`
       - `NN`: zero-padded two-digit chapter number (`00`-`99`)
       - `slug`: ASCII lowercase + digits + hyphens only (e.g. `01-overview.md`, `04-oauth-oidc.md`)
       - Strict regex: `^(0\d|[1-9]\d)-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$`
     - **Reserved chapter** (`kind: "reserved"`): one of `00-metadata.md` / `99-unresolved.md` / `traceability.md`.
     - **User-custom chapter** (`kind: "user_custom"`): every file name listed in `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables` (e.g. `manual.md`, `quickstart.md`). The relaxed regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*\.md$` applies; the user-provided file name is preserved verbatim.
     - **Chapter title in body**: handled independently of the file name. Rendered in `goal.json.output_language` (EN example: `# Chapter 1: Overview` / JA example: `# 第1章: 概要`).
     - **Chapter numbers are assigned by the main agent in Phase 2** and fixed in `wbs.json.chapters[].file_name`. Sub-agents never decide naming; they save under the file name handed down by the main agent.
   - **Reserved numbers / file names** (must always be generated):
     - `00-metadata.md` (metadata chapter)
     - `99-unresolved.md` (unresolved-items chapter)
     - `traceability.md` (traceability table, no chapter number)
   - Regular chapter numbers are assigned sequentially in `01`-`98` while avoiding collisions with reserved numbers.
   - **When to generate them**: at Phase 2, create empty chapter files under `drafts/` for all chapters — standard, reserved, AND user-custom — so every chapter has a skeleton to fill (the body is filled in Phase 3 / Phase 5 / Phase 6 depending on `kind`).
   - Place a meta comment (`<!-- meta: ... -->`) at the top of each chapter file describing what that chapter covers.
   - The skeleton of `00-metadata.md` carries a meta comment indicating "Phase 6 will write goal.json snapshot / generation timestamp / commit hash / template selection result here".
   - The skeleton of `99-unresolved.md` carries a meta comment indicating "Phase 6 will aggregate `abandoned` entries from `questions.json` here".
   - The skeleton of `traceability.md` carries a meta comment indicating "Phase 6 will write the chapter/section → source mapping table here".
   - Every user-custom skeleton carries a meta comment indicating "Phase 3/5 will fill this chapter per the user's intent recorded in `goal.json.free_text_notes`; Phase 6 verifies it exists in `final/` via check 12 (existence + non-empty body)."

   #### Skeleton content contract (strict)

   The Phase 2 skeleton is **deliberately near-empty**. Every chapter draft file created in Phase 2 must contain **exactly** the following, and **nothing else**:

   1. The `<!-- meta: ... -->` comment line described above.
   2. One blank line.
   3. The chapter title `#` heading, rendered in `goal.json.output_language`.
   4. (Optional, for `standard` chapters only) a single placeholder line `## Sources Read\n\n(to be filled in Phase 3)` — the literal `## Sources Read` heading is preserved verbatim in English even when output language is Japanese, because `coverage-check.py` matches on the English string.

   Total body length per skeleton MUST be **≤ 5 non-blank lines** outside of code fences. This cap is the structural enforcement of "Phase 2 ≠ Phase 3".

   **Forbidden in Phase 2 skeletons** (writing any of these is a contract violation and rolls back the file):

   - ❌ Entity / module / route / endpoint tables (those are Phase 3 STEP A-C outputs based on real `glob`/`grep`/`view` reads of the codebase).
   - ❌ `[REF: path:line]` citations (Phase 3 STEP B).
   - ❌ Mermaid diagrams (Phase 3 outline-mode OUT-B for `06-diagrams.md`).
   - ❌ Confidence labels (🟢/🟡/🔴) — these belong to populated tables, not skeletons.
   - ❌ Prose explaining "what this module / class does" — that's Phase 3's job after `view`-ing the file.
   - ❌ Cross-references like "see Chapter 5" before Phase 3 has actually decided Chapter 5's content.
   - ❌ Any sentence written from training-data knowledge of the framework / library / project. Phase 2 has NOT read the code yet; anything written here would be guessed, not grounded.

   **Why this restriction exists**: previous runs had Phase 2 writing 300+ line "skeletons" filled with entity tables (Confidence 🟡 = "grep hit unread"), generated from the model's prior knowledge of Rails / Django / etc., not from the actual repository. Phase 3 then either rubber-stamps that unverified content into `final/`, or re-does the work redundantly. The fix is to make the skeleton structurally too small to hold body content — if you find yourself wanting to write a table or a [REF:], you are no longer building a skeleton, you are doing Phase 3 work, **STOP**.

   **Example of a correct skeleton** (standard chapter; the title heading and placeholder text are rendered in `output_language` — EN shown here, JA variant shown after):

   ```markdown
   <!-- meta: Entities table - exhaustive listing of models/structs/types/classes/interfaces -->

   # Chapter 2: Entities

   ## Sources Read

   (to be filled in Phase 3)
   ```

   JA equivalent (when `output_language == "ja"`):

   ```markdown
   <!-- meta: Entities table - exhaustive listing of models/structs/types/classes/interfaces -->

   # 第2章: エンティティ

   ## Sources Read

   (Phase 3 で記入予定)
   ```

   Note that the meta comment and the `## Sources Read` heading stay English in BOTH variants (they are structural markers `coverage-check.py` and the chapter pipeline match on). Only the chapter title (`# Chapter 2: Entities` / `# 第2章: エンティティ`) and the placeholder phrase switch by `output_language`.

   That is the entire file. No table. No entity names. No `belongs_to` notes. No diagrams. Phase 3 fills the rest after reading the real source.

   **Example of a violating skeleton** (do NOT do this in Phase 2 — EN shown for illustration):

   ```markdown
   <!-- meta: Entities table - ... -->

   # Chapter 2: Entities

   ## 2.1 Core entities

   | Entity | File | Description | Status |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `Issue` | `app/models/issue.rb` | A tracked unit of work | 🟡 |
   | `Project` | `app/models/project.rb` | Container for issues | 🟡 |
   ...
   ```

   Even though the table looks plausible, it was written without reading `issue.rb` — the 🟡 label means "grep hit only, body unread", which Phase 2 has no business claiming. Save this for Phase 3 where the table cells get grounded in actual `view` output.

2. **Create the WBS**
   - Define sub-tasks that fill each chapter. The model is "1 sub-task = 1 sub-agent".
   - Sub-task granularity: split each sub-task to "a size that preserves accuracy". Too big → coarse output; too small → overhead.
   - **Include every user-custom deliverable** from `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables` as a `chapters[]` entry with `kind: "user_custom"`. These chapters share the existence/non-empty gate (check 12) but are exempt from comprehensive per-chapter gates (200 lines / 10 REFs / Mermaid / Sources Read); their quality bar is defined by the user's intent (`source_intent`) confirmed via Phase 5 dialogue.
   - Save the WBS to `wbs.json`. Schema:

   ```json
   {
     "chapters": [
       {
         "chapter_id": "ch-01-overview",
         "chapter_title": "Chapter 1: Overview",
         "file_name": "01-overview.md",
         "kind": "standard",
         "assigned_inventory_ids": ["INV-001", "INV-002"],
         "status": "pending"
       },
       {
         "chapter_id": "ch-manual",
         "chapter_title": "Customer Manual",
         "file_name": "manual.md",
         "kind": "user_custom",
         "source_intent": "顧客向けドキュメント。Mermaid図による視覚的説明と、紙芝居的なmanual.mdを含める。",
         "assigned_inventory_ids": [],
         "status": "pending"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   <!-- chapter_title example: EN "Chapter 1: Overview" / JA "第1章: 概要" — chosen by output_language -->

   - `file_name` is required; for `kind: "standard"` it must match `^(0\d|[1-9]\d)-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$`; for `kind: "reserved"` it must be one of the three reserved names; for `kind: "user_custom"` it must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*\.md$` AND appear in `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables`.
   - The three files `00-metadata.md` / `99-unresolved.md` / `traceability.md` appear with `kind: "reserved"` and an empty `assigned_inventory_ids` array; Phase 6 fills their bodies.
   - `source_intent` (user-custom only) verbatim-quotes the snippet of `free_text_notes` that established the deliverable, so Phase 3/5 has the user's words at hand.

3. **Inventory extraction (v2: source-map.py based)**

   **STEP A (required)**: Run `scripts/source-map.py` to extract source units automatically:
   ```bash
   python .cc-rsg/skill/scripts/source-map.py \
     --target <target root> \
     --output .cc-rsg/source-map.json
   ```
   This enumerates language-specific classes, modules, routes, migrations, views, etc. as `SRC-NNNN`.

   **STEP B (required)**: Derive the minimum INV count from `source-map.json`'s `stats.files_scanned`:
   ```
   inventory.json minimum count = max(50, files_scanned // 20)
   ```
   Falling below this fails `coverage-check.py`.

   **STEP C**: Consulting `references/inventory-units.md`, group `source-map.json` units into conceptual units per language catalogue:
   - Examples (per language):
     - PHP: classes, traits, functions, route definitions
     - COBOL: PROGRAM-ID, SECTION, PARAGRAPH
     - Python: modules, classes, functions, endpoints
     - Java: classes, methods, endpoints, entities
     - JavaScript/TypeScript: exported functions, components, routes
     - **Ruby on Rails**: always cover the 14-item "Ruby on Rails catalogue" in `inventory-units.md` (Controller/Model/Concern/Service/Job/Mailer/Helper/Lib/Migration/Route group/View group/JS module/Config/Mailer template).

   **STEP D**: macro/group/module style types are forbidden. Always 1 class / 1 module / 1 action per row.

   Save the result to `inventory.json`. Schema:

   ```json
   {
     "units": [
       {
         "id": "INV-001",
         "type": "controller",
         "name": "IssuesController",
         "file": "app/controllers/issues_controller.rb",
         "line": 20,
         "covered_by": [],
         "related_source_ids": ["SRC-0142", "SRC-0143"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   `related_source_ids` links to `source-map.json` units; this enables the MECE check in Phase 4.

4. **Map WBS chapters to inventory items**
   - For each inventory item, decide which chapter covers it in the WBS.

5. **🆕 Adjust the chapter structure based on depth mode (the mode confirmed in Phase 1.5)**

   Branch the WBS chapter structure on `.cc-rsg/goal.json`'s `depth_mode`:

   **(a) `comprehensive` (classic / audit use)**
   - Distribute `assigned_inventory_ids` across the 13-chapter template outline.
   - Phase 3 generates ≥ 200 lines / ≥ 10 REFs per chapter.
   - **For large repos this takes hours to days. Assumes an audit reader.**

   **(b) `outline` or `interactive` (recommended default)**
   - **Chapters are restructured to "table-first"**. Use `references/outline-tables.md` to decide per language.
   - **Required chapters (Layer 1: MECE-guaranteed)**:
     - `01-modules-overview.md` — Modules table (exhaustive responsibility partitioning)
     - `02-entities.md` — Entities table (exhaustive listing of models / structs / types / classes / interfaces)
     - `03-actions.md` — Actions table (exhaustive listing of controllers / handlers / endpoints)
     - `04-data.md` — Data table (DB schema / migrations)
     - `05-dependencies.md` — Dependencies table (gem / pip / npm, etc.)
   - **Required chapters (Layer 2: relationship visualisation)**:
     - `06-diagrams.md` — Mermaid (ER diagram, module dependency, representative sequences, state transitions)
   - **Optional chapters (as needed)**:
     - `07-flows.md` — Per-use-case sequences (multiple)
     - `08-cross-cutting.md` — Cross-cutting concerns: auth / logging / transactions, etc.
   - **Reserved chapters stay** as `00-metadata.md` / `99-unresolved.md` / `traceability.md`.
   - **Do NOT enforce the 200-line body / 10-REF requirements**. Instead, `coverage-check.py` checks that **each table enumerates every entity**.
   - Record `depth_mode` on each chapter in `wbs.json` so Phase 3 / 4 can branch on it.

6. **User review**
   - Display the WBS and the skeleton and ask the user "Is it OK to start Phase 3 with this decomposition?".
   - In outline / interactive mode, also call out that the chapters are "overview-table-first" and obtain consent.

7. **Phase 2 complete**
   - Update `state.json` and proceed to Phase 3.

### Phase-specific cautions
- Inventory extraction scripts are generated by Claude on the fly. Pre-built generic scripts cannot keep up with language-specific details.
- WBS granularity directly drives sub-agent precision. When in doubt, split finer.
- Skipping the user review causes large rework in Phase 3.
- **Strictly observe the chapter file naming convention**. Free-form names like `chapter2_architecture.md` or `第3章_認証.md` are NOT allowed. Violations are flagged by `scripts/coverage-check.py`.
- **Skeleton size cap (mandatory)**: every file under `drafts/` produced in Phase 2 has **≤ 5 non-blank lines** of body outside code fences. Verify this immediately after writing each skeleton (`wc -l drafts/*.md` for a sanity check); a skeleton that is already long has body content that belongs in Phase 3 — delete the body and keep only meta comment + title + (optional) Sources Read placeholder.
- **Phase 2 does NOT read code**: the only allowed source reads in Phase 2 are (a) for inventory extraction via `source-map.py`, (b) for deciding the depth_mode chapter structure. Reading individual class / model / controller files to write their description is **Phase 3's job**, not Phase 2's. If you catch yourself opening `app/models/issue.rb` to write what `Issue` does, you've crossed into Phase 3 — stop and finish Phase 2 first.

---

## Phase 3: Investigate (read code, then write chapters)

### Purpose
Based on the WBS, **read the real source code first, then write each chapter**.

### 🆕 depth-mode branching (important)

`.cc-rsg/goal.json`'s `depth_mode` **changes Phase 3's overall behaviour**:

| depth_mode | Main behaviour | Chapter body shape |
|---|---|---|
| `comprehensive` | Apply STEP A-F below to every chapter | Long form: ≥ 200 lines + ≥ 10 REFs + ≥ 1 Mermaid + ≥ 5 Sources Read |
| **`outline` / `interactive`** | **STEP A-F are replaced for Layer 1 / 2 chapters** (see "outline-mode chapter writing" below) | Table-first + relationship diagrams + deep-dive candidate list |

In `outline` / `interactive` mode the following `comprehensive`-only STEPs do NOT apply:
- "200 lines or more" body length enforcement
- "10 REFs or more" citation enforcement
- "5 Sources Read or more" required count

Instead, use the **outline-mode writing rules** (below).

---

### Mandatory principles (strict) — for `comprehensive` mode

To make "writing a chapter without opening the code" structurally impossible, perform each chapter in this order:

#### STEP A: Sources Read (mandatory; skipping causes Phase 4 failure)

For every INV in that chapter's `wbs.json.chapters[*].assigned_inventory_ids`, **use the Read tool on the corresponding real source files**.

List the viewed file paths and line ranges at the **top of the chapter under a `## Sources Read` section**:

```markdown
# Chapter 5: Data Model

## Sources Read
- `app/models/issue.rb` (lines 1-440)
- `app/models/project.rb` (lines 1-690)
- `app/models/user.rb` (lines 1-120)
- `db/migrate/0042_create_orders.rb` (lines 1-50)
- `app/models/concerns/soft_delete.rb` (lines 1-95)

## 5.1 Overview
...
```

**Minimum 5 files** under Sources Read. `coverage-check.py` enforces this count. Writing `[REF:]` citations for files that are not listed is forbidden.

> Examples shown use Rails conventions. For catalogues covering PHP /
> Python (FastAPI / Django) / Java (Spring) / JavaScript & TypeScript
> (Express / Fastify / Hono) / Ruby on Rails, see
> `references/inventory-units.md`.


#### STEP B: Citation extraction (mandatory)

Extract at least **10 concrete citations** from the viewed code, all in **exactly one format**:

```
[REF: <workspace-relative path>:<Lstart>]
[REF: <workspace-relative path>:<Lstart>-<Lend>]
```

Examples:

```
[REF: app/models/issue.rb:42-56]
[REF: app/models/issue.rb:120-145]
[REF: config/routes.rb:7]
```

**Strict format requirements** (the UI's REF chip click-to-source feature parses these — variant formats render as plain non-clickable text, breaking reviewer flow):

- Use **`[REF: path:line]` or `[REF: path:start-end]` only**. The square brackets, the `REF:` prefix, and the colon between path and line numbers are all mandatory.
- The path is workspace-relative (`app/...` for an env with `archiveRoot = "myapp-main"`). Absolute paths are forbidden.
- Line numbers are integers. Use a single line (`:42`) when a single line is being cited; use a range (`:42-56`) when an extent matters. Do NOT use `L42`, `line 42`, ` lines 42-56`, parentheses, or any other decoration.
- Forbidden alternative forms include but are not limited to:
  - ❌ `Gemfile (lines 1-138)` — parenthesised line annotation
  - ❌ `<!-- Gemfile lines 1-138 -->` — HTML comment marker
  - ❌ `// app.js lines 1-5` — JS-style comment marker
  - ❌ `[REF: Gemfile L1-L138]` — leading `L`
  - ❌ `[REF: Gemfile, lines 1-138]` — comma + word "lines"
  - ❌ `[REF: Gemfile]` — no line numbers at all

Line ranges are precise (coarse ranges like `:1-500` are not acceptable). Cover class definitions, key methods, configuration values, callbacks, validations, exception handling, etc.

#### STEP C: Write the chapter body (required quality bar)

Incorporate the citations into the body. **Per-chapter mandatory requirements**:

| Item | Minimum | Verification script |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Body lines | ≥ 200 | coverage-check.py |
| `[REF:]` count | ≥ 10 | coverage-check.py |
| fenced code block | ≥ 3 | coverage-check.py |
| Mermaid diagrams | ≥ 1 | coverage-check.py |
| Sources Read items | ≥ 5 | coverage-check.py |

Chapters that fail these are rejected in Phase 4 and loop back to Phase 3 for correction.

Around each `[REF: ...]`, add prose explaining "what is happening". Writing only what Rails/Laravel-style frameworks "typically do" is forbidden — write what the **actual code** does after reading it.

#### STEP D: Uncertainty markers

Surface uncertainty in each statement:
- `[CONFIDENCE: HIGH | MED | LOW]`
- `[ASK SME]` (needs confirmation from a subject-matter expert)
- `[ASSUMED: ...]` (basis for the inference)

#### STEP E: Add detail questions to the Question Bank

Questions that surface while writing a chapter are added to `questions.json` (at least 1 per chapter). The final `questions.json` must contain **≥ 10 items** (`coverage-check.py` enforces this).

Examples:
- Is this method retrying three times because of a technical constraint or a business requirement?
- What is the rationale for this configuration value?
- Is this commented-out code a transient remnant or part of the spec?

#### STEP F: Handle critical questions

If a critical question is hit, leave the corresponding section as `[BLOCKED: see Q-042]` (empty). Loop back from Phase 5 (after dialogue) to Phase 3 to fill it in.

#### STEP G: Per-chapter sub-agent delegation (use when the `task` tool is available; recommended)

In environments where the `task` tool is available, **delegate each chapter to an isolated `chapter-investigator` sub-agent**. Writing every chapter directly in the main agent degrades context; investigating each chapter in its own context yields higher quality.

**Sub-agent invocation template:**

```
task(
  description="ch05 data-model investigation",
  prompt=\"\"\"
You are the chapter-investigator handling Chapter 5: Data Model.

Target inventory_ids:
- INV-012 (Project)
- INV-013 (Issue)
- INV-014 (User)
- INV-015 (Role)

Corresponding real sources (Read these with the Read tool):
- app/models/project.rb
- app/models/issue.rb
- app/models/user.rb
- app/models/role.rb
- db/schema.rb (relevant portions)

Draft output path: .cc-rsg/drafts/05-data-model.md

Quality bar:
- Body ≥ 200 lines
- [REF: path:Lstart-Lend] ≥ 10
- fenced code blocks ≥ 3
- Mermaid diagrams ≥ 1 (ER diagram)
- ≥ 5 files under ## Sources Read

When done, return the chapter's key points + a list of detail questions raised.
The detail questions are material for the main agent to append into questions.json.

NOTE: If goal.output_language == "ja", render the chapter body, headings,
prose, and detail-question text in Japanese. Keep code blocks, file paths,
JSON keys, [REF: ...] markers, and the literal heading "## Sources Read"
in English.
\"\"\",
  subagent_type="chapter-investigator"
)
```

**Important constraints**:

- **MANDATORY: Emit ALL chapter `task()` calls in a SINGLE assistant turn (parallel dispatch).**
  This is the most important rule of Phase 3. Read carefully — getting it wrong makes Phase 3 take **N× longer** than it needs to.

  **WRONG (sequential — DO NOT DO THIS):**
  ```
  Assistant turn 1: task("ch-02 ...")             ← issue ONE task
                    ← wait for the Observation
  Assistant turn 2: task("ch-03 ...")             ← then issue the next
                    ← wait
  Assistant turn 3: task("ch-06 ...")
                    ...
  ```
  This pattern serialises everything. If each `chapter-investigator` takes 4 minutes and you have 8 chapters, Phase 3 takes ~32 minutes. The runtime's sub-agent concurrency pool is **wasted** because you only ever have 1 sub-agent in flight at a time.

  **CORRECT (parallel — REQUIRED):**
  ```
  Assistant turn 1: task("ch-02 ...")
                    task("ch-03 ...")
                    task("ch-06 ...")
                    task("ch-08 ...")
                    task("ch-11 ...")
                    ... (one task() per chapter, ALL emitted back-to-back)
                    ← yield, do NOT plan / think / write anything else
  Single Observation turn: receives all N results at once
  ```
  In one assistant turn, emit one `task()` tool call per chapter, back-to-back, with NO intervening text, NO `thought`-style narration, NO partial writes — just the task calls. Then yield control. The runtime fans them out concurrently and returns all Observations together when they complete.

  With a sub-agent concurrency of 5 and 8 chapters: ~2 batches of ~4 minutes each → ~8 minutes total instead of 32. **Wall time scales by `1 / concurrency`**.

  **Self-check before emitting `task()`:**
  Have you written the prompts for **every** chapter that needs investigation in this Phase 3 round? If not, finish drafting them first, THEN emit them all together. Never emit one and "see how it goes" — that is the sequential anti-pattern.

  **Runtime concurrency mechanics.** Claude Code's `Task` tool dispatches sub-agents in parallel up to its own pool. Other runtimes integrating the same skill should configure their own sub-agent pool similarly so the batch actually runs in parallel rather than being serialised at the executor level.

- **Prompt cache is NOT shared**: each sub-agent has an isolated LLM context, so token usage is 5–10× the main agent.
- **The sub-agent writes the chapter draft directly via the Write tool** (saved as a file, NOT returned in the task result text). The main agent reads the return value and appends detail questions into `questions.json`.
- **One `task()` per chapter**. Bundling all chapters into a single `task` call defeats the purpose (the isolated context per chapter disappears).

**When the `task` tool is unavailable**, the main agent performs STEP A-F itself per chapter.

---

### 🆕 outline-mode chapter writing (when `depth_mode == "outline" | "interactive"`)

This section does NOT apply in `comprehensive` mode. In outline mode, Phase 3's behaviour is replaced by OUT-A through OUT-D below.

#### OUT-A: Generate Layer 1 chapters (02-entities / 03-actions / 04-data / 05-dependencies)

Each Layer 1 chapter **exhaustively lists the "overview table" for that language**. Procedure:

1. Consult `.cc-rsg/skill/references/outline-tables.md` for the per-language catalogue.
2. **Use `glob` + `grep` to mechanically extract every entity**:
   - Ruby/Rails models: `grep "^class \\w+" --type ruby app/models/`
   - Controllers: `grep "^class \\w+Controller" --type ruby app/controllers/`
   - Etc., using the patterns from outline-tables.md for the target language.
3. Render the result as an **exhaustive Markdown table** — no omissions. 1 entity = 1 row.
4. Always add a **Confidence label** in each cell (🟢 VERIFIED / 🟡 INFERRED / 🔴 ASSUMED):
   - 🟢: the file of that entity was confirmed by reading it with the Read tool
   - 🟡: only the `grep` hit was confirmed; body unread
   - 🔴: inference based on framework-typical behaviour
5. The summary column is 1 line (≤ 80 characters). **Do not write detailed logic** — leave that to Layer 3 deep-dives.

**At the end of each chapter you MUST place a "deep-dive candidates" section** (see OUT-C).

#### OUT-B: Generate Layer 2 chapter (06-diagrams) — Mermaid

- ER diagram (auto-derived from Entities + Data tables)
- Module dependency diagram
- Representative sequence (1–3 of the most typical request flows)
- State-transition diagram (when key entities have `status` columns, etc.)

Each diagram has a **one-line caption** and a "how to read this" hint. If a diagram cell is `[INFERRED]`, say so explicitly.

#### OUT-C: "Deep-dive candidates" list at the end of each Layer 1 chapter

Place at the end of each chapter, using this format:

```markdown
### Deep-dive candidates (refer to them by ID)

- **D-001**: M-013 `Issue` class — authorisation guard logic [🔴 ASSUMED, complex]
- **D-002**: C-018 `ProjectsController#index` — visibility decision [🟡 INFERRED, business-critical]
- **D-003**: Sequence "Issue notification delivery" — subscribers resolution [🔴 ASSUMED]
```

Selection criteria (see the end of references/outline-tables.md):
1. Rows with many 🔴 ASSUMED labels.
2. High-complexity rows (top 10% by method count / association count / file line count).
3. Rows containing business-critical keywords (auth / payment / permission / audit, etc.).

#### OUT-D: Drop the body-length constraints

In outline mode:
- **The "200 lines / 10 REFs / 5 Sources Read" requirements do NOT apply.**
- Instead the MECE criterion is "**every entity appears in some row of some table**" (Phase 4's `coverage-check.py` decides this automatically).
- The chapter body consists of: table + 1–2 paragraphs of explanation + Mermaid diagrams (where applicable) + the deep-dive candidates list.

---

### Phase-specific cautions
- **In `comprehensive` mode**: writing a chapter without reading the code is forbidden. You may cite only files listed in Sources Read. ≥ 200 lines / ≥ 10 REFs / ≥ 5 Sources Read must be satisfied.
- **In `outline` / `interactive` mode**: "exhaustive entity listing" takes precedence. Apply Confidence labels honestly per cell — do NOT over-apply 🟢 (only for files actually viewed).
- Cross-chapter consistency is checked in Phase 4.
- Do not hide uncertainty markers; keep them explicit in the draft. They are the starting point for Phase 5 dialogue.
- **Phase 3 progression gate (mandatory)**: do NOT declare Phase 3 complete unless **every** chapter in `wbs.json.chapters[]` (standard, reserved, AND user_custom) has a non-empty body in `drafts/` (at least 10 non-blank lines outside of code fences). The agent MUST verify this before updating `state.json` to mark Phase 3 complete; declaring "complete" while chapters are still stubs is a contract violation and triggers an immediate Phase 4 fail.

---

## Phase 4: Verify (checks + loopback)

### Purpose
Run inventory cross-check, per-chapter quality metrics, MECE check, and consistency checks automatically, looping failing chapters back to Phase 3.

### Procedure

1. **Generate trace.json**
   ```bash
   python .cc-rsg/skill/scripts/build-trace.py --cc-rsg-dir .cc-rsg --target-dir-for-required drafts
   ```
   This resolves every `[REF: path:line]` in `drafts/*.md` to a SRC unit and produces the MECE aggregation.

2. **Run coverage-check.py (mandatory; exit code is binding)**
   ```bash
   python .cc-rsg/skill/scripts/coverage-check.py \
     --cc-rsg-dir .cc-rsg \
     --target-dir-for-required drafts \
     --output-format text
   ```
   This invocation is **non-optional**. The script's exit code is the gate:
   - `0` → all checks pass; Phase 4 may proceed.
   - `1` → at least one check failed; go to step 3 (loopback). Recording `all_quality_gates_passed: true` in `state.json` while exit is 1 is forbidden.
   - `2` → required artefacts (e.g. `inventory.json`) missing; surface to user.

   Checks performed (12 total):
   - inventory count (min: `max(50, files / 20)`)
   - macro-type INV ratio (max 20%)
   - covered_by fill rate (90%)
   - per-chapter body lines (≥ 200), `[REF:]` count (≥ 10), code blocks (≥ 3), Mermaid (≥ 1), Sources Read items (≥ 5) — **applied only to `kind: "standard"` chapters; `user_custom` chapters are exempt**
   - questions count (≥ 10), open ratio (≤ 20%)
   - MECE coverage (≥ 70%)
   - **Check 12 — User-custom deliverables**: every filename in `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables` must exist in the target directory (`drafts/` in Phase 4, `final/` in Phase 6) AND have a non-empty body (≥ 10 non-blank lines outside code fences).

3. **Failure → loop back to Phase 3**
   - When exit code is 1, read the "gate decision" section of the output and:
     1. Identify the failed chapter (e.g. `chapter 05-data-model.md: [REF:] count is 7 < required 10`)
     2. **Read additional sources** corresponding to the chapter's `assigned_inventory_ids`
     3. Add to Sources Read, raise `[REF:]` count, thicken the body
     4. Re-run coverage-check.py
   - For `user_custom` chapters that are missing or empty, treat the failure the same way: return to Phase 3 and fill the chapter using `wbs.json.chapters[].source_intent` and any Phase 5 dialogue answers that pertain to it.
   - Maximum iterations: **3**. If a `kind: "standard"` chapter still fails after 3 attempts, record it in `99-unresolved.md` as "insufficient quality" and continue. A failing `kind: "user_custom"` chapter must NOT be silently demoted to `99-unresolved.md`; instead, prompt the user via `AskUserQuestion` to (a) keep retrying, (b) reduce scope, or (c) abandon the deliverable explicitly.

4. **Cross-reference verification**
   - Check whether any cross-chapter inconsistency exists for the same concept.
   - File inconsistencies into `questions.json` with `priority: critical`.

5. **Deduplicate questions**
   - Detect duplicates across the entire Question Bank.
   - Merge only the "obviously identical"; flag the "similar but subtly different" as groups for Phase 5 confirmation.

6. **Save the verification report**
   - Save `coverage-check.py --output-format json` output to `.cc-rsg/coverage-report.json`.
   - Save a human-readable version to `.cc-rsg/coverage-report.md`.

7. **Phase 4 complete**
   - Once every chapter passes (or hits the 3-attempt qualitative limit), update `state.json` and proceed to Phase 5.

### Phase-specific cautions
- **Do not proceed to Phase 5 until coverage-check.py PASSes** (up to 3 loop iterations). Setting `phase_4.all_quality_gates_passed: true` is only allowed when the most recent `coverage-check.py` invocation returned exit code 0.
- The loopback is not "padding the prose" — its purpose is to **read more real code, add more citations, and thicken the explanation**.
- Missing cross-chapter inconsistencies makes Phase 5 dialogue explode. Squash them in Phase 4.
- **`coverage_rate` < 100% with `all_quality_gates_passed: true` is a contradiction** and is never permitted. If full coverage is impossible within 3 iterations, leave `all_quality_gates_passed: false`, record the unfinished chapters, and surface to the user instead of advancing.

---

## Phase 5: Refine via Dialogue

### Purpose
Through dialogue with the user, resolve uncertainty markers and the Question Bank, refining the spec.

### All 3 stages are mandatory

`coverage-check.py` enforces `--max-open-ratio 0.2`, so leaving more than 20% of items as `open` blocks progression to Phase 6. Run all 3 stages.

#### Stage 1: Present the big picture (mandatory, once)

Ask the user **a single question** via `ask_user_question`:

```
Unresolved questions: N items
Per-category breakdown: business_rule X, architecture Y, data_model Z, ...
Per-severity breakdown: critical X, important Y, nice-to-have Z

Pick a progress mode:
- Answer every question one by one (most thorough)
- Answer only critical ones (faster)
- Mark every remaining question abandoned and skip to Phase 6 (fastest, lower quality)
```

choices: `["Answer all", "Critical only", "Skip with abandoned"]`, allow_free_text: true

#### Stage 2: Present critical clusters (mandatory, at least 3 clusters)

If Stage 1 selects "Answer all" or "Critical only", group the critical questions into related clusters.
**At least 3 clusters** are required (if fewer naturally, split mid-grain).

Present each cluster as one `ask_user_question`:
```
Business-rule cluster A (#Q-005, #Q-008, #Q-012)
These are questions around the purchase flow.
Answer them in sequence?

- Answer in sequence (recommended)
- Postpone this cluster
- Mark this cluster abandoned
```

#### Stage 3: Per-question dialogue (the rest of the questions)

Present each question via `ask_user_question`:

- **question**: the relevant code excerpt + tentative assumption + risk
- **choices**: `["Inference is fine (reflect in spec)", "Enter the correct answer", "Need SME confirmation, skip", "Cannot ever resolve (abandoned)"]`
- **allow_free_text**: true

Reflect the answer into the corresponding entry in `questions.json`:
- `Inference is fine` → `status: answered`, `answer: <tentative inference>`
- `Enter the correct answer` → `status: answered`, `answer: <user free-form input>`
- `Need SME confirmation` → `status: skipped`
- `abandoned` → `status: abandoned`

### To prevent Phase 5 "padding" by the agent

**If `questions.json` has fewer than 10 entries**:
- Before starting Phase 5, review the Phase 3 drafts and extract at least 5 ambiguous spots into `questions.json`.
- Extraction angles:
  - Spots where the naming convention or design intent is unclear
  - Spots where the business rule can only be inferred
  - Spots where error-handling policy admits multiple interpretations
  - Special implementations diverging from framework defaults
  - Handling of unused / deprecated code

### Applying answers

- Reflect each answer into the corresponding chapter draft (remove or update uncertainty markers).
- Fill in `[BLOCKED: see Q-NNN]` sections.
- **Answers that define a new deliverable structure are actions, not notes.** If a dialogue answer fixes the contents/sections of a `kind: "user_custom"` chapter that is still empty (or fixes a new file the user introduced in Phase 5), the agent MUST:
  1. Update the corresponding `wbs.json.chapters[]` entry — set or refine `chapter_title`, `assigned_inventory_ids`, and append the answer text to `source_intent`.
  2. Push the chapter back to Phase 3 (re-open with `status: "pending"`) and run a `chapter-investigator` pass (or the in-line equivalent) to actually write the file.
  3. Re-run `coverage-check.py` after Phase 3 finishes. Only when the file exists with body content may the chapter be marked `status: "done"`.
- Recording the user's answer in `99-unresolved.md` or in `state.json.phase_5.user_feedback` **without** triggering chapter creation is a contract violation: the user asked for a deliverable, not for a note about a deliverable.

### Re-reconnaissance (only when needed)

If the answer makes additional investigation necessary, re-read the relevant code with the Read tool as an extra step in Phase 3 and update the chapter.

### Phase 5 completion criteria

Satisfy `coverage-check.py`'s `--max-open-ratio 0.2` criterion:
- At least 80% of all questions are `answered` / `skipped` / `abandoned`
- Strictly less than 20% remain `open`
- Continue Phase 5 until this is reached.

### Phase 5 skip prevention (mandatory)

Phase 5 dialogue must actually happen. Recording `phase_5.status: "complete"` while:
- `questions.json` contains ≥ 20% of questions with `status: "open"`, OR
- Zero `AskUserQuestion` calls have been emitted in Phase 5, OR
- No question entry in `questions.json` has a populated `answer` field

— is a contract violation. Each of these states is an automatic Phase 5 fail; the agent must restart the 3-stage dialogue, not advance to Phase 6.

Concretely, before declaring Phase 5 complete the agent MUST:
1. Count `open` vs total questions. If `open / total > 0.2`, continue dialogue.
2. Verify at least the **Stage 1 overview** AND the **Stage 2 critical clusters** dialogues were actually presented to the user via `AskUserQuestion` (Stage 3 individual questions for the residual). Internal notes or `state.json.phase_5.user_feedback` strings do NOT substitute for actual dialogue.
3. Record per-question `answered_by` (user vs. agent inference) and `answered_at` (real UTC timestamp). Bulk-marking 50 questions as "answered" without dialogue is a contract violation.

The Phase 6 intent-vs-delivery audit re-verifies these constraints; failure routes back to Phase 5.

### Phase-specific cautions
- Skipping Stage 1 / Stage 2 and doing only Stage 3 is forbidden (the user loses the big picture).
- Demanding SME-grade answers for every question breaks the dialogue. `nice-to-have` items are allowed to remain as inferences.
- `abandoned` is reserved for "truly unanswerable in the long term" cases — do not abuse it as a shortcut.
- **Bulk marking dozens of questions as `answered` without dialogue is a contract breach** — the user did not answer them; the agent silently dropped them. The correct action is either to actually run the dialogue, or to honestly mark them `abandoned` with a reason.

## Phase 6: Deliver

### Purpose
Output the final spec as Markdown under `.cc-rsg/final/`.

### Procedure

File names follow the ASCII slug convention finalised in Phase 2 (`^(0\d|[1-9]\d)-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$`; reserved files: `00-metadata.md` / `99-unresolved.md` / `traceability.md`). Phase 6 does not create new names; it fills in the skeleton files generated in Phase 2.

1. **Merge chapter drafts**
   - Copy every chapter in `wbs.json.chapters[]` — standard, reserved, AND user_custom — from `drafts/` to `.cc-rsg/final/` in the template-defined order (user-custom chapters typically appear at the end unless the user's intent suggests otherwise).
   - Do NOT change the file names (use the names finalised in Phase 2).
   - Do NOT silently skip a chapter just because its draft body is short — that is a Phase 3 / Phase 4 failure and must be surfaced, not papered over.
   - Strip the meta comment at the top of each chapter file.

2. **Generate the traceability table (fill in `traceability.md`)**
   - Phase 2 created `traceability.md` as an empty file; write its body now.
   - Generate a table mapping each chapter/section to the source code it references.
   - Format example:

   ```markdown
   | Spec section | Source |
   |----------------|--------|
   | 3.2 User deactivation | src/jobs/UserDeactivationJob.php:12-58 |
   ```

3. **Generate the "Unresolved items" chapter (fill in `99-unresolved.md`)**
   - Phase 2 created the empty file; write its body now.
   - Aggregate `questions.json` entries with `status: abandoned`.
   - For each unresolved item, record "why it could not be resolved", "how far we inferred", "what is needed to resolve it in the future".
   - The chapter title in the body follows `goal.json.output_language` (EN example: `Chapter 99: Unresolved Items` / JA example: 「第99章: 未確定事項」). The file name `99-unresolved.md` is fixed regardless of language.

4. **Generate metadata (fill in `00-metadata.md`)**
   - Phase 2 created the empty file; write its body now.
   - Include: generation timestamp, commit hash of the target codebase (if available), goal definition finalised in Phase 0, template selection result, cc-rsg version.

5. **Final deliverable layout**
   ```
   .cc-rsg/final/
   ├── 00-metadata.md       # metadata (created Phase 2, filled Phase 6)
   ├── 01-overview.md       # Chapter 1: Overview
   ├── 02-architecture.md   # Chapter 2: Architecture
   ├── 03-...each chapter...md
   ├── 99-unresolved.md     # Unresolved items (created Phase 2, filled Phase 6)
   ├── traceability.md      # Traceability table (created Phase 2, filled Phase 6)
   ├── manual.md            # Example: a user-custom deliverable declared in goal.json
   └── README.md            # Reader's guide for the deliverable (generated in Phase 6)
   ```
   Note: standard / reserved file names are ASCII slug-fixed (language-independent); user-custom file names match the verbatim entries in `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables`. Chapter titles in the body follow `goal.json.output_language` (EN example: `# Chapter 1: Overview` / JA example: `# 第1章: 概要`).

6. **Intent-vs-delivery audit (mandatory; the final gate before completion)**
   - Re-run `coverage-check.py` against `--target-dir-for-required final`. Exit code must be 0.
   - Verify that every filename listed in `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables` exists at `.cc-rsg/final/{name}` AND has a non-empty body (≥ 10 non-blank lines outside code fences). Demoting any of these to `99-unresolved.md` or recording them as "for next time" in `state.json` is forbidden.
   - Verify that the three reserved files (`00-metadata.md`, `99-unresolved.md`, `traceability.md`) all exist under `final/`.
   - **Verify state.json invariants**:
     - `current_phase` must equal `6` (and only `6`) when Phase 6 completes. Earlier values such as `2` while `phase_6.status: "complete"` are inconsistent and indicate the agent advanced phases out of order — fail Phase 6 in that case.
     - For every `i` from 0 to 6, if `phase_i.status == "complete"`, then `phase_j.status` for `j < i` MUST also be `"complete"`. No skipping allowed.
     - `session_history[]` array MUST be present and non-empty. Missing or empty `session_history` indicates the agent never recorded any phase transition and is a contract violation.
     - The Phase 5 skip-prevention conditions (see Phase 5 "skip prevention" section) must hold: `questions.json` open-ratio ≤ 20%, ≥ 1 `AskUserQuestion` emitted in Phase 5, ≥ 1 question with populated `answer` field.
   - If ANY check fails: do NOT mark Phase 6 complete. Instead, reopen the offending chapter(s) (`wbs.json.chapters[].status = "pending"`), return to Phase 3 or Phase 5 as appropriate, and loop. Repeat until every check passes.
   - If after additional Phase 3/4 iterations the agent still cannot deliver a `user_custom` chapter (e.g. the source code does not support it), use `AskUserQuestion` to obtain explicit user permission to drop the deliverable; only an explicit user opt-out justifies skipping the file. Record the decision in `state.json.phase_6.user_opt_outs[]` with the reason.

7. **Timestamps in `state.json`**
   - Every entry in `state.json.session_history[]` and every `last_updated` / `completed_at` / `timestamp` field MUST use a real UTC timestamp captured at write time (e.g. `date -u +%FT%TZ`). Using a placeholder like `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z` for every event is forbidden — it makes post-mortem analysis impossible.
   - **Detector for placeholder timestamps**: if every `session_history` entry shares the same suspiciously round timestamp (`T00:00:00Z`, `T12:00:00Z`, or evenly-spaced 10-minute intervals like `T12:00:00Z`, `T12:10:00Z`, …), that is almost certainly synthetic. Regenerate `session_history` with real capture-time values, even retroactively if the original timing was not recorded — note that the timestamps are approximations and explain why in `00-metadata.md`. Never silently keep synthetic timestamps.

8. **Completion notification**
   - Report to the user the deliverable location, the total page (or section) count, number of resolved questions, number of unresolved items, AND the list of `user_custom_deliverables` that were delivered.
   - Mark `state.json` as complete only after step 6 passes.

### Phase-specific cautions
- The "unresolved items" chapter (`99-unresolved.md`) must NOT be omitted. It is the root of the spec's credibility.
- Omitting the metadata chapter (`00-metadata.md`) loses "when, from which version of the code" the spec was generated.
- Omitting the traceability table (`traceability.md`) makes every statement's origin untraceable.
- The presence of the three required files (`00-metadata.md` / `99-unresolved.md` / `traceability.md`) AND every file in `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables` is verified by `scripts/coverage-check.py`; missing files raise errors.
- **Pushing a user-promised deliverable into "future improvements" of `99-unresolved.md` is a contract breach**, not a graceful degradation. The user did not ask for a recommendation that the file be made; they asked for the file. If the file cannot be made, ask the user, do not invent a workaround.

## 🆕 Phase 6.5: Deep-dive acceptance mode (when `depth_mode` is `outline` or `interactive`)

### Purpose

In `outline` / `interactive` modes, the spec at the end of Phase 6 is only "overview tables + Mermaid + deep-dive candidates". **The user reading the spec points out items of interest and asks for on-the-spot deep-dives** — that is the essence of these modes. Phase 6.5 holds the agent in a **deep-dive acceptance state**, waiting for explicit user instructions, until the env is closed.

### Behaviour

After the Phase 6 completion report, the agent emits the following message and **waits for input**:

```
✅ Overview spec generation is complete (X chapters / Y tables / Z deep-dive candidates).

Check the "Deep-dive candidates" section at the end of each chapter.
For items of interest, instruct like this:

- By candidate ID:  "Deep-dive D-001" / "D-007"
- By entity ID:    "Tell me more about M-013 Issue" / "C-018 ProjectsController"
- By natural text: "Explain the authorisation model" / "How does Issue notification delivery work?"

To end the deep-dive mode, reply "end" / "complete" / "OK, done".
```

### Recognising and processing instructions

Recognise user input via the following patterns:

1. **Explicit ID (highest priority)**: matches `D-NNN` / `M-NNN` / `C-NNN` / `T-NNN`, etc. → look up the row/candidate in `wbs.json` / `inventory.json` / per-chapter tables → obtain the file and overview.
2. **Direct entity name**: `Issue class` / `ProjectsController`, etc. → identify the file via `grep`.
3. **Natural-language topic**: keywords like `authorisation` / `notification` / `payment` → keyword-search the relevant chapters/table rows, present the top 3 to the user, and ask "Which one do you want to deep-dive?".

### Generating a deep-dive chapter

Once the deep-dive target is fixed:

1. Launch the `chapter-investigator` sub-agent via the `task` tool.
2. Sub-agent prompt:
   - Target entity / candidate ID and overview
   - List of related real source files
   - "Write 1 chapter at **comprehensive-mode-equivalent quality**" (≥ 200 lines, ≥ 10 REFs, ≥ 1 Mermaid, ≥ 5 Sources Read)
   - Output path: `.cc-rsg/drafts/deep/D-NNN-{slug}.md` or `M-NNN-{slug}.md`
3. Display the key findings returned by the sub-agent in the main thread.
4. **Update traceability.md** (append the deep-dive chapter).
5. **Update the relevant row in the original Layer 1 chapter**: bump the confidence from 🟡/🔴 → 🟢, add a "see deep-dive `D-001`" link.
6. Report completion and return to the input-waiting state.

### Ending

When the user sends a completion word ("end", "complete", "OK, done", etc.):

1. Update `state.json` with `phase_6_5_completed_at`.
2. Re-generate `final/` (consolidating the deep-dive chapters).
3. Update final/traceability.md to the final version.
4. Close the env with a thank-you message.

### Phase-specific cautions

- **While waiting for user input, the agent does NOT poll or self-progress**. It moves only after an explicit instruction.
- If a deep-dive is **requested for a target already covered**, surface the existing deep-dive chapter and ask "Regenerate it?".
- Sub-agent return values during deep-dive also follow the **mode B contract** (path + summary), not the full body.
- Be mindful of cumulative cost: each deep-dive equals roughly one comprehensive chapter. Periodically report "N deep-dives so far, cumulative cost ~$X".

## Question Bank operation

### Data structure

Each entry in `.cc-rsg/questions.json` has the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": "Q-042",
  "generated_at_phase": "investigation",
  "category": "business_rule",
  "body": "Is the 3-retry of this payment process driven by a technical constraint or a business requirement?",
  "evidence": {
    "file": "src/payment/PaymentRetryHandler.php",
    "lines": "45-58",
    "code_excerpt": "for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) { ... }"
  },
  "related_inventory_ids": ["INV-027"],
  "severity": "important",
  "resolution_type": "ask_sme",
  "status": "open",
  "answer": null,
  "answerer": null,
  "answered_at": null,
  "related_question_ids": []
}
```

### 7 standard categories

1. **business_rule**: business rules
2. **architecture_decision**: architecture decisions
3. **data_model_intent**: data-model intent
4. **external_integration**: external-system integration
5. **naming_history**: naming and historical context
6. **operational_requirement**: operational requirements
7. **security_compliance**: security / compliance

Users may add custom categories as needed (v1 expects manual JSON editing; UI is a future extension).

### Severity levels

- **critical**: cannot write the chapter without resolving this. The sub-agent leaves the section blank (`[BLOCKED]`).
- **important**: can be written with inference but confidence is low. Leave a `[CONFIDENCE: LOW]` marker.
- **nice-to-have**: a question about fine detail. Write with inference and lightly confirm in Phase 5.

### Status transitions

```
open → asked → answered
            ↓
            abandoned
```

## Sub-agent behaviour

### Sub-agent prompt template (skeleton)

The prompt skeleton handed to the Task tool in Phase 3. The complete version lives in `references/subagent-prompt.md`.

```
You are an investigation agent in charge of a specific chapter.

[Goal definition (excerpt from goal.json)]
- Output language: {output_language}  ("en" or "ja")
- Primary reader: {primary_reader}
- Granularity: {granularity}
- Perspectives: {perspectives}

[Output-language handling]
- The chapter body, headings, prose explanations, annotations on uncertainty markers, and the chapter-end detail-question list are ALL rendered in {output_language}.
- Machine-readable elements — file names (ASCII slug), `[REF: file:lines]`, `[CONFIDENCE: HIGH|MED|LOW]`, `[ASK SME]`, `[ASSUMED: ...]`, `[BLOCKED: see Q-XXX]`, IDs (`Q-XXX` / `INV-XXX`) — stay English regardless of {output_language}.
- Even when the reference assets (`templates/*.md`, `references/*.md`) are written in Japanese, when {output_language} == "en" you must dynamically translate the chapter heading examples and body samples into semantically equivalent English before writing the chapter body.

[Assigned chapter]
- Chapter title: {chapter_title}
- Inventory items to cover: {inventory_ids}
- Template definition (the structure of this chapter): {template_section}

[Working instructions]
1. Carefully read the source code corresponding to the assigned inventory items.
2. Write the chapter body.
3. For every statement, attach a `[REF: file:lines]` citation with precise line ranges.
4. Do not hide uncertainty; use the following markers:
   - [CONFIDENCE: HIGH | MED | LOW]
   - [ASK SME]
   - [ASSUMED: <inference>; basis: <evidence>]
   - [BLOCKED: section left empty because of a critical question]
5. At the end of the chapter, append a "detail questions raised in this chapter" list.

[Constraints]
- Never conflate inference with fact.
- Do not write detail beyond the goal granularity.
- When a critical question is hit, leave the section as [BLOCKED] and report completion.

[Output format]
{See references/subagent-prompt.md for details}
```

### Sub-agent decision logic

When a question is encountered, the sub-agent follows this pseudocode:

```
if question.severity == "critical":
    leave the section as [BLOCKED: see Q-XXX]
    register the question in the Question Bank
    finish the rest of the chapter as much as possible
    report completion
else:
    leave a [CONFIDENCE: LOW; ASSUMED: <inference>] marker
    inferred best-effort completion of the chapter
    register the question in the Question Bank
    report completion
```

## State management and resume

### Schema of `state.json`

```json
{
  "current_phase": 3,
  "phase_progress": {
    "phase_3": {
      "total_subtasks": 12,
      "completed_subtasks": 8,
      "blocked_subtasks": ["chapter_payment", "chapter_auth"]
    }
  },
  "started_at": "2026-05-01T10:00:00+09:00",
  "last_updated": "2026-05-01T14:32:15+09:00",
  "session_history": [
    {"timestamp": "2026-05-01T10:00:00+09:00", "phase": 0, "event": "started"},
    {"timestamp": "2026-05-01T10:15:00+09:00", "phase": 1, "event": "transitioned"}
  ]
}
```

### Resume behaviour

When the skill detects an existing `.cc-rsg/state.json` at startup, present the situation in the resume message and confirm the user's intent. If `.cc-rsg/goal.json` is readable, the resume message is rendered in its `output_language`. Only when `goal.json` itself is missing (so the language is unknown) the bilingual format (English first, then Japanese) is used — identical in shape to Phase 0 Step 3 — to prompt the language selection again.

**Resume-message template (English version, when `output_language: "en"`)**:

```
A previous cc-rsg session is in progress. The current state is:

- Current phase: Phase 3 (Investigate)
- Progress: 8 of 12 sub-tasks completed; 2 BLOCKED on critical questions
- Question Bank: 23 unresolved questions (2 critical)
- Last updated: 2026-05-01 14:32

What would you like to do?
(A) Resume from where it stopped (finish remaining Phase 3 tasks)
(B) Roll a phase back (resume from a specified phase)
(C) Full reset (delete .cc-rsg/ and start from Phase 0)
(D) Show detailed state, then decide
```

**Resume-message template (Japanese version, when `output_language: "ja"`)**:

```
前回のセッションで cc-rsg を実行しています。状況は以下の通りです。

- 現在のフェーズ: Phase 3 (Investigate)
- 進捗: 12サブタスク中8件完了、2件は critical な疑問により BLOCKED 状態
- Question Bank: 未解決疑問 23件(うち critical: 2件)
- 最終更新: 2026-05-01 14:32

以下のいずれを実施しますか?
(A) 続きから再開(Phase 3 残タスクを完了させる)
(B) Phase を巻き戻す(指定する Phase から再開)
(C) 全リセット(.cc-rsg/ を削除して Phase 0 から開始)
(D) 状況を詳細表示してから判断する
```

Per-phase resume message details will be moved into a separate doc in a follow-up.

## Reference docs and templates

The skill depends on the following reference docs and templates. They live under `references/` and `templates/` next to this file.

### Under `references/`

- `references/inventory-units.md`: per-language / per-framework inventory unit definitions (PHP, COBOL, Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, etc.)
- `references/template-catalog.md`: template selection guide
- `references/question-categories.md`: 7-standard-category details and how to add custom categories to the Question Bank
- `references/verification-checklists.md`: verification checklists used in Phase 4
- `references/subagent-prompt.md`: the complete sub-agent prompt used in Phase 3
- `references/outline-tables.md`: per-language overview-table catalogue for outline mode

### Under `templates/`

- `templates/web-app.md`: web-application spec template
- `templates/batch-system.md`: batch-system spec template
- `templates/api-service.md`: API-service spec template
- `templates/library-sdk.md`: library / SDK spec template

### Under `scripts/`

- `scripts/source-map.py`: scans the target codebase for source units and produces `source-map.json`
- `scripts/build-trace.py`: resolves `[REF:]` markers in drafts against source-map.json into `trace.json`
- `scripts/build-traceability.py`: renders human-readable `traceability.md` from `trace.json`
- `scripts/coverage-check.py`: verifies inventory coverage, draft quality, MECE, etc. (Phase 4)

## Key implementation principles

### Honesty above polish
A polished, finished-looking spec is less valuable than an honest spec whose gaps are visible. Clearly separate what Claude inferred from what the code unambiguously says, and surface `abandoned` questions as "unresolved items".

### Guarantee traceability
Every statement must be traceable to a specific source-code location with a line range. This inherits the KDM (Knowledge Discovery Metamodel) "Source package" idea and is a hard requirement for a spec that maintenance developers can audit later.

### Respect progressive refinement
Do not aim for a perfect spec on the first pass. Phase 1 → overall picture; Phase 2 → skeleton; Phase 3 → chapter drafts; Phase 5 → refinement. Insert a user review at each phase.

### Guarantee resumability
For long-running analysis sessions, record progress / established facts / unresolved questions on the file system so the work can be paused and resumed at any time (inheriting the `.reversa/state.json` idea).

---

## Known issues and mitigations

### Phase 1 reconnaissance does not finish because the codebase is too large
- Explicitly narrow the scope (a specific module inside a monorepo, etc.).
- Consider adding a "target scope" question to the 5 goal-definition questions in Phase 0.

### Sub-agent context explodes during parallel investigation
- Keep "1 sub-agent = 1 chapter" as the principle; subdivide chapters further to keep individual contexts small.
- Pass only the relevant excerpts of `goal.json` and `inventory.json`; do not pass unrelated files.

### The Question Bank grows unmanageable, breaking the dialogue
- Use Phase 4 normalisation to merge duplicates.
- Filter by severity; talk through `critical` items first.

### The user cannot spare time for the reviews
- Design the per-phase reviews as "approve to move on".
- Allow postponing detailed review until the final deliverable in Phase 6, and reviewing the whole thing in one batch.

---

## Versioning and changelog

- v0.5.0 (2026-06-15): intent-vs-delivery enforcement + post-pilot quality hardening.
  - **Mermaid styling contract**: every Mermaid diagram in `drafts/` / `final/` is structure-only (no per-node fill, no hex colours, no `style ... fill:`). The rendering host supplies a theme-aware palette so dark/light/auto themes look consistent.
  - **`user_custom_deliverables` enforcement**: Phase 0 extracts `*.md` filename mentions from `free_text_notes` and persists them as `goal.json.user_custom_deliverables`. Phase 2 adds those files to `wbs.json.chapters[]` with `kind: "user_custom"` under a relaxed naming regex. Phase 6 audits that every one of them exists in `final/` with a non-empty body (≥ 10 lines outside code fences). `coverage-check.py` check 12 enforces this.
  - **Strict `[REF: path:line]` / `[REF: path:start-end]` format**: forbidden variants (`(lines X-Y)`, `<!-- file lines a-b -->`, `[REF: ... L1-L138]`, `[REF: file, lines 1-138]`, `[REF: file]` with no lines, etc.) enumerated explicitly so downstream parsers can rely on the shape.
  - **Phase 5 skip prevention**: refusing `complete` when `status: open` ratio ≥ 20%, no `AskUserQuestion` call was made, or zero `answer` fields are populated.
  - **Phase 3 progression gate**: every chapter in `wbs.json.chapters[]` (standard, reserved, AND user_custom) must have a non-empty body (≥ 10 non-blank lines) before Phase 3 can be marked complete.
  - **Question-text quality contract**: no `\uXXXX` JSON escapes in AskUserQuestion text, kanji confusion-pair self-check (`妥/妊`, `暑/署`, `復/複`, ...).
  - **Optional `variants/B/`** for Context Optimization mode B (per-chapter Task delegation with manifest relay) — opt-in via `goal.json.context_optimization_mode = "B"`.
  - **`coverage-check.py`** dynamic NAMING_EXEMPT to exempt user-custom file names from the chapter-naming regex.
- v0.4.1 (2026-06-11): minor consistency pass — neutralised runtime-specific phrasing in SKILL.md and outline-tables.md.
- v0.4.0 (2026-06-09): English-base migration of the entire skill bundle (SKILL.md, `agents/`, `variants/`, `templates/`, `references/`, `scripts/`). `goal.json.output_language` defaults to `"en"`; Phase 0 Step 3 prompts the user bilingually.
- v0.3.0 (2026-06-08): Depth modes (`comprehensive` / `outline` / `interactive`). Outline mode generates Layer 1 + Layer 2 overview chapters with confidence labels (🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴). New `references/outline-tables.md` covering 6 stacks.
- v0.2.0 (2026-06-06): per-chapter sub-agent delegation, Phase 4 loopback verification, granularity rules, Rails catalog in `references/inventory-units.md`, output-language selection.
- v0.1.0 (2026-05-01): initial draft. Defines the Phase 0-6 state machine, Question Bank, sub-agent behaviour, and file layout.
